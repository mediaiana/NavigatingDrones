% Time Complexity: O(dâ‹…n), where d is number of Drones and n is the average number of nodes in the tree
% Because we have 2 loops: outer loop goes through each drone and inner one loops through each node in the tree for each node

% Space Complexity: O(1), because it doesn't use extra large amount of memory
