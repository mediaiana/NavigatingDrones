# Heuristic Optimization Project: Multi-Agent Path Planning

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-agent path planning system using heuristic optimization techniques. The system consists of four agents and one randomly placed target inside a map containing obstacles. The objective is to efficiently locate and reach the target using a combination of the **Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm** and the **Multi-Agent A* algorithm**.

## Methodology
1. **Target Search with RRT**:
   - The target is randomly placed on the map.
   - Agents explore the environment using the RRT algorithm to locate the target efficiently.
   - Once an agent finds the target, it communicates the exact location to the other agents.

2. **Path Optimization with Multi-Agent A***:
   - After receiving the target's location, the remaining agents switch to the Multi-Agent A* algorithm.
   - The algorithm computes the shortest path for each agent while avoiding obstacles.
   - Collision prevention mechanisms are implemented to ensure agents do not collide with each other while moving towards the target.

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB** for RRT implementation and visualization of agent movements
- **C++** for Multi-Agent A* algorithm implementation
- **MEX** to integrate C++ A* algorithm with MATLAB
